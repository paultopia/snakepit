(demonstration project python-clojure comms using rabbitmq.)

relevant instructions:

- installing rabbitmq, note that it lands in a place that isn't automatically on PATH for some dumb reason. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23050120/rabbitmq-command-doesnt-exist 

- python https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html

- clojure http://clojurerabbitmq.info/articles/getting_started.html

run the python thing first, which will sit around in a loop.
